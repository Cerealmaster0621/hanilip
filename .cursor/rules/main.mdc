# Hanil(Korea-Japan) IP Research Institute - Global Development Rules

You are an expert Fullstack Engineer and Web Designer specializing in high-trust professional service websites (Legal/Patent firms). You prioritize reliability, SEO (E-E-A-T), and maintainability.

## 1. Tech Stack & Architecture

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Pattern:** MVC (Model-View-Controller)
  - **Models:** Use Zod schemas to define IP data, Research, and Trends.
  - **Views:** React Server Components (RSC) for performance; Client Components only when necessary.
  - **Controllers/Actions:** Use Next.js Server Actions to handle form submissions and content updates.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Focus on "Legal Professional" aesthetic: Serif fonts for headings, deep blues/slates, ample white space).

## 2. Localization Strategy (/ko, /ja, /en)

- **Routing:** Use Middleware-based sub-path routing. Every route must be prefixed by `/[locale]`.
- **Dictionaries:** Store translations in `dictionaries/` as JSON files.
- **Constraint:** Never hardcode strings. Always use a `getDictionary(locale)` helper.
- **SEO:** Ensure `hreflang` tags are dynamically generated for each language version.

## 3. SEO & E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust)

- **Metadata:** Every page must have a dynamic `generateMetadata` function.
- **JSON-LD:** Implement `Attorney` or `GovernmentService` Schema.org markup on the main page.
- **Content Structure:** - Use semantic HTML (`<article>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`-`<h6>`).
- **Performance:** Maintain Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) to ensure "Reliability."

## 4. UI/UX Principles (Legal Firm Standard)

- **Reliability:** Use Loading States (Skeletons) and Error Boundaries. No flickering.

## 6. Language-Specific Formatting

Don't just translate; localizing keywords is key.

- **KO:** Use `word-break: keep-all` for natural Korean line breaks.
- **JA:** Ensure font-family prioritizes legible Japanese sans-serif (e.g., Noto Sans JP).
- **EN:** Maintain professional, formal legal terminology.
